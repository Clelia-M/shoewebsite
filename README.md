# ðŸ‘Ÿ Amazing Shoes Website

## Description

Trainers product Landing page. This project was created following Traversy Media tutorial on YouTube.

It is built in HTML and CSS with no use of SAAS even if it was part of the tutorial. It was created mobile-first with just a few lines of media queries to get it respnsive on desktop view. 

I love building product pages like this because it hels me better understand the use of HTML and CSS in a real-world environment.
This one in particular is also completely responsive so I've learned how to use different media queries in CSS and the correct use of float.
